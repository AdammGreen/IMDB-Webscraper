    "#what is an API:\n",
    "    #An API(Application Programming Interface) is a software that allows two applications to talk to each other. \n",
    "    #in this case it would be between my python notebook and the OMDB website. This allows my notebook (as the client) to connect to\n",
    "    #the websites server and hence retreieve information from it. OMDB is a RESTful server meaning it follows REST (REpresentational State Transfer.) arcitechure. \n",
    "    # Another example of a similar a server would be the familair HTTP architecture. The underlying protocol for REST is actually HTTP but\n",
    "    #they are not one in the same. \n",
    "    #REST is a way to transfer and request sources from one application to another. \n",
    "    #The OMDB website revolves around it being a database of movies and their information that people can access to test their webscraping programs\n",
    "    #and abilities. It is a educational website to some extend and you can support this initiave via patreon\n",
    "    #The OMBD import from pypi is a wrapper with certain predefined requests/functions/classes that can be called which make coding and\n",
    "    #interacting with the OMDB API website easier and more structured. You can call these operations via ombd.\"yourChosenMethod\"\n",

    "#Key details on OMBD API and how it is interacted with:\n",
    "    #The OMDB API is interacted with via an omdb import and API key. The import allows you to connect to the API in your program and the key\n",
    "    #which can be created on the OMDB API website is what validates that you are a legitimate client and can access transfer from their website.\n",
    "    #the API key appears to be a hex code.\n",
    "    #Once you have established a connection to their server, you can then use json to scrape imformation from the database and have it outputted\n",
    "    #onto the client side.\n",
    "    #You can now use this information to your own descretion. You can further open and write the info into a json or txt file and save it\n",
    "    # Making use of dictionaries is also made easier as the info pulled from OMDB API follows a particular format\n",
    "    #You can now use this information and refine it with dictionarys to give more clear and organised outputs\n",
